# üõçÔ∏è Retail Marketing Optimization with Predictive Modelling

## Business Case

In our organization, retail campaigns are often designed based on broad assumptions about customer preferences, resulting in wasted marketing spend, low conversion rates, and underutilized product opportunities.
This project aims to address that challenge by developing a predictive machine learning model that enables our retail team to make data-driven decisions on which product categories to promote in each marketing campaign, based on customer age demographics.

## Problem Statement

We have access to detailed transaction data, including:
- Customer Age & Gender
- Product Category
- Quantity Purchased
- Price per Unit
- Total Sale Amount
- Transaction Date

Despite having this rich dataset, our current marketing campaigns do not use this information effectively. We want to leverage these insights to predict which product categories are most relevant and profitable for each age group, and use that to guide campaign design.

## Goal

Develop a predictive model that:
- Inputs: Age of the target audience segment
- Outputs: Recommended product category to invest in for marketing
- Helps marketing teams allocate budget wisely, personalize campaign content, and increase conversion rates

## Value Proposition

By implementing this model, we expect to:
- Improve campaign ROI by 15‚Äì30%
- Reduce customer acquisition costs through better targeting
- Increase engagement and customer satisfaction with age-relevant promotions
- Enable data-driven planning for future marketing initiatives
 
## Example Use Case

If a campaign is targeting customers aged 30‚Äì40, the model may recommend focusing on Clothing, while for customers aged 45‚Äì55, it might suggest Beauty or Electronics, depending on historical purchasing behaviour.
